# Dynamic colorimetric experiments in computer vision

> [!warning] Business Profile：
> 
> The sub-business implementation of the computer vision solution project for chemical kinetics. The focus is on addressing the need to identify the sample profile and further obtain accurate color regions when performing colorimetric operations on batch data.
>
> With the help of the OpenCV computer vision model library, operations such as image reading, binarization processing, contour detection, contour fitting, contour area calculation, contour center coordinate calculation, and data export of contour area and center coordinates are realized to meet the business requirements of image colorimetric analysis.
