A physical chemistry learning tool project built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/zh/), incorporating the [TDsign](https://tdesign.tencent.com/vue-next/overview) component library and [VueUse](https://vueuse.nodejs.cn/) utility set to achieve richer interactive effects. Aimed at learning.

## 1. Technology Stack Selection

### 1.1 VitePress Development and Packaging

- VitePress is an SSG (Static Site Generator) framework based on Vite and Markdown, and supports the Vue ecosystem.

- VitePress official documentation: [https://vitepress.dev/](https://vitepress.dev/)

### 1.2 Deep Learning Library: Frontend Development/Build with TensorFlowJS

- For future educational / research-oriented products (such as WebApps), the original intention of this project was to allow students to directly apply and train models using their mobile phones or web browsers (with WebGPU/WebGL hardware acceleration). The reasons for this design are threefold:

  1. It can leverage the computing power of each student's device to complete teaching and simple research tasks.

  1. It can break through the limitations of Nvidia GPUs/CUDA platforms. Core graphics cards, integrated graphics cards, or even mobile phones can achieve hardware-accelerated computation as long as they support WebGPU/WebGL.

  2. It can be deployed for free via the [Pages service](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and with Vite, the process is very convenient. There is no need for application distribution (copying to students or requiring them to download) or installation guidance (writing tutorials or teaching students how to install, deploy, or configure), which greatly reduces the workload.

- Based on the above considerations, to further reduce the various additional workloads between development and productization and focus as much as possible on the business, this project naturally chose the [**TensorFlowJS**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) technology stack. Most of its development and building are frontend-based, and minor data preprocessing and code debugging can also be easily completed with NodeJS on the backend without involving cross-language issues, which significantly reduces the project development workload.

- The drawback of pure web development with TensorFlowJS is the lack of code comments, which is compensated by Vite. The Node development environment under Vite can directly install and call the TensorFlowJS library to obtain official code comments during project development; it can also use dev(/serve) to run/render code in the browser and directly call WebGPU/WebGL for hardware acceleration. This ensures both development and runtime efficiency.

### 1.3 Computer Vision Library: OpenCV.js

- OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) is the most widely used open-source computer vision library in both industry and academic research, and one of the most popular libraries in the field of computer vision.

- [**OpenCV.js Official API Introduction**](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html)

- In terms of invocation, the OpenCV.js provided by the official does not support modular invocation, which is relatively inefficient in application development and deployment. Therefore, we chose the OpenCV.js version on NPM that supports MJS: [@techstark/opencv-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@techstark/opencv-js).

### 1.4 Machine Learning Library: ml.js

- For machine learning tasks, the ml.js library was primarily selected, and basic machine learning tasks have already been implemented.

### 2.2 Naming Convention and Symbol Connection Rules

- **Files**, **Folders**, etc.:

  Mainly use kebab-case, combined with snake\_case when necessary. Specifically:

  For phrases with complete and independent meanings, kebab-case is used between words.

  For terms or phrases with clearly different semantic categories, snake\_case is used.

  Kebab-case is the default, and snake_case is used in special\_cases.

- **Variables**, **Objects**, **Functions**, **Methods**, etc.:

  All use camelCase uniformly.
